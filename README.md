# DataScience_Playground
This repository includes mini projects using the skills I have learnt so far as a data enthusiast. This repository is a code vault and learning journal for my data science journey. I have compiled notebooks on multiple topics for you to play along.

## Notebooks
The notebooks can be found in the */notebooks* folder.
